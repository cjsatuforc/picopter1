# PiCopter
A video-streaming drone made from a $20 quadcopter.

**NOTE: I know the code is an exact copy of the code at https://elinux.org/RPi-Cam-Web-Interface. This repository was only made so I could easily run a cURL and setup the cam: `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cosmicatech/picopter1/master/setup_script.sh | sudo bash`.**
